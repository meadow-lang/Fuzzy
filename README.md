# Fuzzy

Fuzzy matching for [Meadow](https://github.com/meadow-lang/meadow): finding the
texts a few typed letters mean, the likeliest first, and where in each the
letters fell. It is what a picker ranks its list with.

```meadow
use Fuzzy (rank, found, score, places)

rank "vlen" (\d -> d) ["Vector.length", "valueOf", "String.length"]
-- [("Vector.length", Found …), ("String.length", …)]: best first

found "gt" "getText"      -- Just (Found … [0, 3]): the g, and the T of Text
found "ba" "abc"          -- None: the letters are not there in order
```

A query matches a text when its letters are in the text in order, with
anything between them. Of all the ways they can be found, the one reported
scores highest:

- a letter at the start of a word counts for more: the first letter of the
  text, one after punctuation or a space, a capital after a small letter;
- letters next to each other count for more than the same letters apart, and
  each character skipped between two costs a little.

A query with spaces in it is several words: each has to be in the text,
anywhere, and the score is their sum. A small letter in the query matches
either case; a capital matches only a capital.

`rank query text items` answers the items the query is found in, best first;
of two found as well, the one with the shorter text, then the one that came
first. `places` are character indices into the text, in order: what to
highlight.

## AI disclosure

Fuzzy is written with AI coding agents: Anthropic's Claude, through Claude Code.
Most of the code, the tests, the documentation and the commit messages in this
repository were written by an agent, under the direction of the project's
author, who decides the design and what goes in. Read it, and rely on it, with
that in mind.
